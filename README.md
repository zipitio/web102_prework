## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. A lot of my HTML, CSS, JS skills were rusty, but creating this website was a great refresher, and I feel like it all came back in the end.

Creating the search feature was a lot of fun and thinking about how to use existing skills that I learned was great.

It was interesting thinking about reduce/filter functions especially because of their abstract nature.
